# Bank Customer API

This project is a hands-on demonstration of my journey learning Spring Boot and building backend web applications.

# What I Learned

- Spring Framework Basics: Understanding the foundation of Spring and how it powers Spring Boot.

- Annotations: Using Spring annotations for dependency injection, REST controllers, and service layers.

- Spring Boot Basics: Creating and running REST APIs with Spring Boot.

-  Databases & Persistence: Connecting applications to databases and managing data.

- Spring Data JPA: Using JPA for advanced data management and object-relational mapping.

## About This Project

This project applies the knowledge gained to build a fully functional backend application with REST endpoints, database integration, and persistence logic.

I hope this project serves as a helpful reference or inspiration for others exploring Spring Boot and backend development.
